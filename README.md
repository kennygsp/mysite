Welcome to my personal site that I'm using as a portfolio to display
school and personal projects as well as a blog. This is now my third iteration
of my site and also a work in progress still, I'm applying what I'm learning from HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript to constantly update my website to add more functionality and look
more visually appealing.
