                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Technology has always fascinated me from
                    a very young age dating back to my first gaming
                    console, the Nintendo 64. Ever since then I've been
                    hooked, rather than asking for toys as other kids
                    I was asking for the latest computer hardware. At
                    first it was a surface level interest of the technology
                    but it would soon come to change with the impact of 
                    Minecraft. From there I started exploring how to host my 
                    own server so that me and my friends could play and eventually 
                    hosting a server that my entire middle school class would join daily. 
                    I would find myself staying up late constantly messing around with 
                    the plugins code (Java) and found a new love for technology, this new
                    passion is what led me to study IT at Rutgers University in hopes of working
                    in the Tech Industry.
