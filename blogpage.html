                    <h2>The Pros of TikTok</h2>
                    <br>
                        Tiktok has become a platform for people of all different groups to share their mental health struggles, hobbies, and bring awareness to them as well. The pandemic caused many people to seek for safe spaces online, with this gap in many peoples’ lives TikTok was the one to fill it. In 2022 alone the hashtag #MentalHealth had garnished over 20 billion views on the platform, establishing that TikTok was a place for people to share their struggles, learn from therapists, and find community with others that shared the same hobbies or struggles. For many of those facing health difficulties TikTok has become a safe space to share personal mental health experiences in ways that can help in their recovery as well as bringing awareness to those that may be going through a similar experience (Hooper, 2022).

                    <h3>Positive impact on users’ being creativity</h3>
                    <br>
                        Long gone are the days where one would need expensive equipment and team of professionals to be able to explore their creative sides, with TikTok’s easy to use editing tools anyone can create and post content, additionally TikTok’s algorithms promote content based on engagement, allowing for users with less established followings to have their content seen and appreciated by a wide audience. Through the use of collaborations, hashtags, and challenges that encourage users to build on each other’s ideas the app pushes the limit of what can be created on the platform. TikTok encourages its users to be creative and authentic by promoting programs such as the “Creativity Program Beta” which is designed to help creators learn more about how to generate more revenue from their content.

                    <h3>A platform that allows for small business and artists to grow</h3>
                    <br>
                        TikTok has become the new proactive approach for small businesses and artists to increase their popularity. It allows them to connect with a new demographic of customers/listeners that are on the platform, and with the ability to engage with the audience it allows for business owners and artists to create their own community. Long gone are the days of needing heavily edited videos for advertisements, many businesses have turned to making short, simple videos that use CTA text bubbles that have been proven to be effective by a study done by TikTok themselves showing that there is a 152% conversion rate compared to videos that don’t (TikTok, 2023). By incorporating TikTok into their marketing strategies businesses can leverage the platform’s reach, engagement, and creativity to build brand awareness, generate leads, and ultimately drive sales.

                    <h2>The Cons of TikTok</h2>
                    <br>
                        The potential harm on users’ attention span due to excessive content consumption
                        Nothing captivates a user more than the seemingly endless amount of content that they can scroll through but is this amount of content intake healthy on the human brain? A recent study has shown that an influx of information has been causing attention spans to shorten (Lorenz, Monsted, Hovel, Lehmann, 2019), leading to steeper rises and quicker falls of attention towards anything that is trending. Researchers in the study claim that it is due to the competition for recency and abundance of information, resulting in topics being squeezed out in the same time intervals which leaves people having no time to remain on one subject when the next subject is the newest thing everyone is talking about. Users worldwide have averaged a total of 95 minutes per day on TikTok alone (SensorTower, 2022), in this span of time users are endlessly scrolling through hundreds of videos that is recommended by the app’s algorithm which leave users no time to fully grasp the content when the next video has entirely new content.

                    <h3>The development of fake Tourette Syndrome in some users</h3>
                    <br>
                        With users pouring hours of their lives scrolling through TikTok daily, some users have recently started to develop functional tics when previously not having any after viewing content creators with tics. A recent study done by Mariam Hull and Mered Parnes evaluated 6 teenage girls that had no previous history of tics, and started showing abrupt onset tic-like movements after patients had begun viewing the same social media influencer that has tics on TikTok and Youtube. This phenomenon of functional tics appearing after exposure to social media influences with similar movements is known as “modeling”, it is important to note that this study was conducted on a small cohort but raises concerns about the potential spread of functional symptoms via social media platforms such as TikTok. As popularity continues to grow on these platforms it's important that healthcare providers are aware of the possible impact and influence that this constant feed of content has on its users.

                   <h3>How TikTok can lead to depression</h3> 
                    <br>
                        Similarly to developing “fake Tourette Syndrome” A recent study performed on students in Lahore showed that there is a link between poor academic performance as well as having significant mediating effects on depression and anxiety in some users. The study shows that as TikTok addiction increases, academic performance decreases and the students are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. These findings are consistent with previous studies performed and highlights the negative impact of excessive TikTok use on students’ mental health and academic performance. It is important that all users of TikTok manage their time on the platform carefully and prioritize their mental and academic well being rather than spending hours on the platform.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <br>
                        Although TikTok is a great platform that allows anyone to express themselves, the growth of businesses, and bringing awareness to topics it is important to know the potential harms it has on users' mental and physical well being. From my own personal experience with TikTok I believe it's important that we limit ourselves on how much time we spend on the app. I would often find myself scrolling endlessly through hundreds of videos as the hours would pass by and realize how much time I’ve wasted in my day, which would lead me to feel awful about myself, moderation is key. As TikTok is relatively new it's hard to study the long term effects it has on our health but it's important that we study more on how it is harming us rather than letting it hit us all at once. Users should be mindful of the content they create and engage with, and take steps to protect their personal information and privacy as well as the time they spend on the platform itself.
